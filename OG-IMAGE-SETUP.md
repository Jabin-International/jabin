# OG Image Generation Instructions

This file helps you create the perfect social media sharing image for Jabin International.

## Option 1: Quick Setup (Recommended)
1. Open the `og-generator.html` file in your browser
2. Right-click on the blue banner and "Save image as"
3. Save it as `og-image.png` in the `/public` folder
4. The image will be 1200x630px (perfect for social media)

## Option 2: Use Existing Logo
If you want to use the existing logo, make sure it's properly sized:
- Recommended size: 1200x630px
- Format: PNG or JPG
- Should have good contrast and be readable when small

## Option 3: Professional Design Tool
Use tools like:
- Canva (has social media templates)
- Figma (create custom 1200x630px frame)
- Adobe tools
- Online OG image generators

## Current Implementation
The website is currently configured to use:
- `jabin_logo_light.png` as fallback
- Once you create `og-image.png`, update the paths in layout.tsx

## Testing
After adding the image, test social sharing on:
- WhatsApp
- Facebook
- Twitter/X
- LinkedIn
- Discord

You can also use these tools to preview:
- Facebook Sharing Debugger
